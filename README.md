These can be programmed using TinyGo.

There are some Grove sensor kits that you can use for the activity.

Ready to try this out? Go to [./sensor/arduino/](./sensor/arduino/) to get started.

### Bluetooth Sensor

This series of tutorials is intended to help you learn about programming Bluetooth devices using TinyGo and the TinyGo Bluetooth package. Using a Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect IoT microcontroller board and tiny display, discover the Bluetooth devices all around us, and make one of your own.

Ready to Go wireless? Click on [./bluetooth/arduino/](./bluetooth/arduino/) to get started.
